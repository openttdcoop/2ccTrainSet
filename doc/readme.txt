1. About the set:
-----------------

The 2cc Set will include trains from all around the world, drawn in dual company colors, so you, as a player, can select the colors of your trains. Unique things about this set are that electrified railways will be a lot more expensive (default is 10x), to encourage usage of the steam and diesel trains. Especially since electrified railways will be available before 1930. The third railsystem is used for another unique thing; Metro. Metro has the advantage it (un)load and accelerates fast and has higher capacity than trains. However, metro will be slow, and can only carry passengers. This way metro will be useful especially for feeder services within big cities.

Another thing about this set is the (by default) high runningcosts, but this is just when they are in motion. When standing still are the runningcosts are very low.
Note that on MU's is the running cost showed PER unit. This means the price in the purchasewindow is applied to each unit in the train. If the price is shown as 5000$, 5 units (including both heads) is 25 000$.

A nicely readable README with images can be found at the projects website: http://users.tt-forums.net/2cc/index.html

2. Parameters
-------------

Param	Value		Function
1st	0 (default) 	Normal costs 	The nice and high running costs :D
	1	 	Lowered costs 	1/256th Price on running/purchase cost
	2	 	Lowered costs 	1/128th Price on running/purchase cost
	3 		Lowered costs 	1/64th Price on running/purchase cost
	4 		Lowered costs 	1/32th Price on running/purchase cost
	5 		Lowered costs 	1/16th Price on running/purchase cost
	6 		Lowered costs 	1/8thth Price on running/purchase cost
	7 		Lowered costs 	1/4th Price on running/purchase cost
	8 		Lowered costs 	Half Price on running/purchase cost
	9 		Heightened 	Double Price on running/purchase cost

Other parameters set regional engine availability. with
		0: enabled (default)
		1: disabled

2	African engines
3	Asian engines
4	East Euroean engines
5	North American engines
6	South American engines
7	Oceanic engines
8	Scandinavian engines
9	South European engines
10	West European engines

Example: add "7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1" in the "set parameters"-box, and you will get
lowered costs, and everyting but western european engines 

3. GRF Dependencies
-------------------
GRF Name 	Dependancy 		Where to get it 	Readme?
Metro Tracks 	HIGHLY Recommended 	Our download page 	Yes :)

Note: FooBar's Transrapid Tracks are planned to be a recommended dependancy too. 

4. Loading speed on passenger cars
----------------------------------

In this set do we have 3 different "styles" of passenger cars, and they all have different loading speed based on their role in real life
Type 			Loading Speed	Passengers 	Typical Capacity	Typical
			Indiactor	per tick	Per Unit		Running speed

InterCity Trains 	Low 		8 per tick 	40-50 			125mph/200kmh or higher
Commuter Trains 	Medium 		20 per tick 	45-120 			60-100mph/100-160kmh
Metro Trains 		None	 	60 on them all! +-150 			Below 60mph/100kmh
			(own system)

5. Introduction years of track types in the regions
---------------------------------------------------

Region 			Unelectrified rail 	Electrified rail 	Metro rail
North-America		1941: Big Boy 		N/A			1993: Boston 01800
South-America		N/A		 	N/A		 	N/A
Scandinavia		1955: DM7		1942: BM65		1977: M100
Eastern Europe		1974: 811 DMU 		1977: ET41 		1894: Budapest Subway 1986 Stock
Southern Europe		1921: 895 		1961: E646 		N/A
Western Europe		1921: c5/6 		1924: Mat24 		1903: London Underground 1903
Asia			N/A 			1991: SS6 		1987: Tokyo 01 Series
Australia 		1969: 422 		2007: OSCars 		N/A
Africa		 	N/A		 	N/A 			1987: Cairo Metro

Note: This overview is based upon known stats, it is possible the actual GRF got additional vehicles based upon guesstimates. Since the GRF is in development, it's even possible it includes less trains!
